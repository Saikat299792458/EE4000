# Singular Value Decomposition of Trajectory Matrix: Frequency Response Estimation of Noisy Data
# Time Varying Impulse Response Estimation of Different Noisy Composite Signals through SVD

## Introduction Summary:
* Most of our real life signals are noisy and composite in nature.
* The goal here is to establish a relation among the number of formants, their frequency and bandwidth with the distribution of singular values.
* If the formants can be estimated properly, the signal can be reconstructed with minimum error and noise.

## Objectives:
* Impulse response of a simple sinusoid (Convolved with noise) at different frequency and bandwidth
* Impulse response of a composite signal (Convolved with noise) at different frequency and bandwidth and number of formants.
* Impulse response of machine generated speech signal (Klatt synthesizer) altering different factors, e.g. noise type
